    <!--In the CSS box model, every HTML element is treated as a box 
        with four areas.
        The content is surrounded by a space called padding, similar 
        to how bubble wrap separates an item from the box around it.
        -Margin is the area outside of the box, and can be used to 
         control the space between other boxes or elements.
        -Here the bottom element has a larger top margin, pushing 
        it further down the page
